Diamond Dodge

Diamond Dodge is an Android game I built using the Unity game engine.

You are a dot, and the goal of the game is to dodge the incoming diamonds. You have 4 lanes you can jump between by swiping left and right. The diamonds' speed increases exponentially as the game progresses.

There are some stats available, including high score, total accumulated score, total accumulated time playing, and nemesis diamond (the color of diamond you've died to most).
